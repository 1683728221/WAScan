It is designed to find various vulnerabilities using "black-box" method, that means it won't study the source code of web applications but will work like a fuzzer, scanning the pages of the deployed web application, extracting links and forms and attacking the scripts, sending payloads and looking for error messages,..etc. WAScan is built on python2.7 and can run on any platform which has a Python environment.
